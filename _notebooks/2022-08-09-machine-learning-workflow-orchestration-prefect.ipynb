I'll demonstrate how to complete the task using two popular tools: Prefect and ZenML. There are several incredible tools that we cannot include in this article, such as Flyte, Kale, Aro, etc.\n",

    "> As an ML practitioner, you are probably familiar with building ML models using Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, or similar. An **[ML Pipeline](https://docs.zenml.io/developer-guide/steps-and-pipelines)** is simply an extension, including other steps you would typically do before or after building a model, like data acquisition, preprocessing, model deployment, or monitoring. The ML pipeline essentially defines a step-by-step procedure of your work as an ML practitioner. Defining ML pipelines explicitly in code is great because:<br>\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - We can easily rerun all of our work, not just the model, eliminating bugs and making our models easier to reproduce.\n",
    "> - Data and models can be versioned and tracked, so we can see at a glance which dataset a model was trained on and how it compares to other models.\n",
    "> - If the entire pipeline is coded up, we can automate many operational tasks, like retraining and redeploying models when the underlying problem or data changes or rolling out new and improved models with CI/CD workflows.\n",

    "We may have extensive preprocessing that we do not want to repeat every time we train a model, such as in the last blog post where we generated the `corpus` list.\n",
    "We may also need to compare the performance of different models, or wish to deploy the model and monitor data and model performance. Here, ML pipelines come into play, allowing us to specify our workflows as a series of modular processes that can subsequently be combined.\n",

    "Additionally, we may have a machine learning pipeline that we would like to execute every week. We can put it on a timetable, and if the machine learning model fails or the incoming data fails, we can analyze and resolve the issues.\n",

    "Initially, we have a postgresql database and possibly a process that writes data to a parquet file. Next, we use pandas to consume the parquet file and merge it with the API data we're pulling.\n",

    "Clearly, these phases are interconnected; if one fails, the entire pipeline will be impacted.\n",
    "Failure can occur in even unforeseen ways. For example, inbound data is flawed, the API fails to connect at random, and the same is true for MLflow.

    "There are a few unanswered questions in my thoughts that I would like to resolve, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a task in a flow, such as training, requires GPU, should we construct a VM with GPU and run the flow on it? Should I rent the VM for the entire month for just a few of hours of training if I want a monthly schedule? Isn't this significantly more expensive than GCP or AWS serverless services?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is it possible to use a VM to run a Prefect server and a GPU-equipped VM which will be launched a couple of hours every month to run the flow and tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is it possible for Prefect on GCP to have a serverless architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What about running Prefect Orion on a cheap VM and run flows on Kubernetes and store data on GCS? \n",
    "\n",
    "I am aware that all of the aforementioned are achievable with some effort, but I do not know if Prefect offers any solutions to make them easier. In any case, I decided not to continue with Prefect on the Cloud for the time being because I did not find it scalable on my primary Cloud provider (GCP). I will investigate additional tools similar to ZenML to determine how they can assist me find the answers to my questions. In the following blog post, I'll explore ZenML.\n",
