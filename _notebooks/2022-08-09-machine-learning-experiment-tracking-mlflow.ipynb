    "In this series of blog posts, I will describe the entire procedure for developing a machine learning service, from development to deployment to monitoring. This is the final project for the phenomenal [MLOps zoomcamp course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hIUISrluw_A7wDSmfOhErJK). This seriesÂ aims to train a simple sentiment analysis model, deploy it to Google Cloud, and utilize MLOps as much as possible. The program receives an E-commerce clothing review and forecasts if the customer would recommend the product to her friends. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews).\n",

    "We do not focus that much on the model development here. I use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/granjithkumar/nlp-with-women-clothing-reviews) notebook as the reference and will try to do experiment tracking using MLflow. You can check the main notebook for further data preprocessing and visualizations.\n",

    "- optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, and we will use it here. It tackles four primary functions:[[source](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html)]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tracking experiments to record and compare parameters and results (MLflow Tracking). The MLflow Tracking component is an API and UI for logging parameters, code versions, metrics, and output files when running your machine learning code and for later visualizing the results\n",

    "Then, you can compare models in the staging phase and choose one for production deployment. In our example, the accuracy of the deep learning model is higher, thus we advance it to the production stage. When you transition a model to the \"Production\" stage, the model registry simply assigns a label to that model version and does not actually deploy the model to production. Complement the registry with CI/CD code that does actual deployments.\n",
