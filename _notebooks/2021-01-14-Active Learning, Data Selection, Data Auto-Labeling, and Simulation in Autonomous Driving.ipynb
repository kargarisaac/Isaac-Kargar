The primary task is to determine what the dataset should ideally represent in these proportions. One sampling technique for data selection is data querying based on metadata information.\n",

Its goal is to select a diverse dataset that covers all possible scenarios, ensuring that the model is trained even on edge or corner cases. By using a diverse training subset, redundant samples and over-represented data that can lead to overfitting are removed, improving model accuracy. It should be noted that some of the other approaches mentioned here may also fall into this or other categories.

If the models agree on the outcome, it means the data point is similar to the data used to train the model and is hence uninformative. If models disagree on the data, it implies that the models lack sufficient information about the sample, and there is something to be learned from this data point.\n",

For example, for a classification task, the entropy for the distribution over different classes can be calculated. If the probability for one class is much higher than others, the calculated entropy would be low which means the model is certain about that sample. And if the probabilities for all classes or several classes are almost the same, the calculated entropy would be high and this shows the model is uncertain about the data point and it will be selected to be labeled. To summarize, the idea behind uncertainty-based sampling is that algorithms ensure that data, where the model is uncertain, is added to the training set.\n",

The idea is to train a model with dropout but does not turn the dropout off in the inference phase. Then feeding the data point into the model with dropout several times. It would be somehow similar to the ensemble idea but just needs to train one neural network. The entropy idea can be used here too similar to the previous case.\n",

As a result, active learning using uncertainty improves the performance over the classes that the model works already well.

    "On the other hand, consistency-based methods perform well on samples coming from hard classes. The idea in consistency-based methods is that during training, both labeled and unlabeled data are used for model optimization, with cross-entropy loss encouraging correct predictions for labeled samples and consistency-based loss encouraging consistent outputs between unlabeled samples and their augmentations. During sample selection, the unlabeled samples and their augmentations are evaluated by the model developed during the training stage. The consistency-based metric is used to evaluate their outputs.

The idea is to use again both labeled and unlabeled data and pass them through the detector. There are two losses in their method: one is the supervised loss for labeled data and the other one is the consistency loss which is for both labeled and unlabeled data.

They ask the fleet to find scenarios where a car from the left or right lane transitions to the ego lane. Then they go backward in time and automatically annotate that scenario and train neural networks on it. So the neural network will pick up many of these patterns and learn from them. As Andrej says, the neural network may also learn about the left or right blinkers, which show lane change internally from these examples without any hard-coding. After the whole training procedure, they can deploy the model in shadow mode. So, in shadow mode, the network always makes predictions about the events and acts as a trigger to find mispredictions. These false positives and false negatives detected freely by the cut-in network will be added to the training dataset and go into the explained Data Engine and training procedure. After several rounds of the same process for the cut-in network, and when they are happy with the performance, the trained model can be turned on and take control of the car instead of being in shadow mode.\n",

It is the 3D position of lines, edges, curbs, traffic signs, traffic lights, cars, their positions, orientations, depth, velocity, etc. It gets raw image data and outputs the vector space for the scene.
