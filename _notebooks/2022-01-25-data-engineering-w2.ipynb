Additionally, data pipelines can share the same source and sink, allowing the pipeline to focus entirely on data modification.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cloud Composer is a GCP managed service for Airflow. Composer runs in something known as a Composer environment, which runs on Google Kubernetes Engine cluster. It also makes use of various other GCP services such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Cloud SQL - stores the metadata associated with Airflow,\n",
    "\n",
    "> - App Engine Flex - Airflow web server runs as an App Engine Flex application, which is protected using an Identity-Aware Proxy,\n",
    "\n",
    "> - GCS bucket - in order to submit a pipeline to be scheduled and run on Composer, all that we need to do is to copy out Python code into a GCS bucket. Within that, it'll have a folder called DAGs. Any Python code uploaded into that folder is automatically going to be picked up and processed by Composer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> How Cloud Composer benefits?\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Focus on your workflows, and let Composer manage the infrastructure (creating the workers, setting up the web server, the message brokers),\n",
    "\n",
    "> - One-click to create a new Airflow environment,\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Easy and controlled access to the Airflow Web UI,\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Provide logging and monitoring metrics, and alert when your workflow is not running,\n",
    "\n",
    "> - Integrate with all of Google Cloud services: Big Data, Machine Learning and so on. Run jobs elsewhere, i.e. other cloud provider (Amazon).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Of course you have to pay for the hosting service, but the cost is low compare to if you have to host a production airflow server on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Airflow on-premise\n",
    "\n",
    "> - DevOps work that need to be done: create a new server, manage Airflow installation, takes care of dependency and package management, check server health, scaling and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "> - pull an Airflow image from a registry and creating the container\n",
    "\n",
    "> - creating a volume that maps the directory on local machine where DAGs are held, and the locations where Airflow reads them on the container,\n",
    "\n",
    "> - whenever you want to submit a DAG that needs to access GCP service, you need to take care of setting up credentials. Application's service account should be created and downloaded as a JSON file that contains the credentials. This JSON file must be linked into your docker container and the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable must contain the path to the JSON file inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To sum up, if you don’t want to deal with all of those DevOps problem, and instead just want to focus on your workflow, then Google Cloud composer is a great solution for you."
