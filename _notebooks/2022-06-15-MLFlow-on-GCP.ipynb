In addition, the scientists will not lose their local data if they want to scale their machine or change it. Everything is decentralised.\n",

    "> MLflowâ€™s Tracking Server supports utilizing the host as a proxy server for operations involving artifacts. Once configured with the appropriate access requirements, an administrator can start the tracking server to enable assumed-role operations involving the saving, loading, or listing of model artifacts, images, documents, and files. This eliminates the need to allow end users to have direct path access to a remote object store (e.g., s3, adls, gcs, hdfs) for artifact handling and eliminates the need for an end-user to provide access credentials to interact with an underlying object store. <br><br>\n",
