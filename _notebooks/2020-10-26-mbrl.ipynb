    "# Model Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL)\n",

    "## Introduction and Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Having access to a model of the world and using it for decision making is a powerful idea. \n",
    "There are a lot of applications of MBRL in different areas like robotics (manipulation- what will happen by doing an action), \n",
    "self-driving cars (having a model of other agents decisions and future motions and act accordingly),\n",
    "games (AlphaGo- search over different possibilities), Science ( chemical usecases),\n",
    "and peration research and energy applications (how to allocate renewable energy in different points in time to meet the demand).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In sequential decision making, the agent will interact with the world by doing action $a$ and getting the next state $s$ and reward $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- States $S \\epsilon R^{d_S}$\n",
    "- Actions $A \\epsilon R^{d_A}$\n",
    "- Reward function $R: S \\times A \\rightarrow R$\n",
    "- Transition function $T: S \\times A \\rightarrow S$\n"
