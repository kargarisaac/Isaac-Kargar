    "A service account is a special kind of account used by an application or compute workload, such as a Compute Engine virtual machine (VM) instance, rather than a person. Applications use service accounts to make authorized API calls, authorized as either the service account itself, or as Google Workspace or Cloud Identity users through domain-wide delegation.\n",
    "For example, a service account can be attached to a Compute Engine VM, so that applications running on that VM can authenticate as the service account. In addition, the service account can be granted IAM roles that let it access resources. The service account is used as the identity of the application, and the service account's roles control which resources the application can access.\n",

    "Today’s enterprises rely on the effective collection, storage, and integration of data from disparate sources for analysis and insights. These data analytics activities have moved to the heart of revenue generation, cost containment, and profit optimization. As such, it’s no surprise that the amounts of data generated and analyzed, as well as the number and types of data sources, have exploded.\n",
    "Data-driven companies require robust solutions for managing and analyzing large quantities of data across their organizations. These systems must be scalable, reliable, and secure enough for regulated industries, as well as flexible enough to support a wide variety of data types and use cases. The requirements go way beyond the capabilities of any traditional database. That’s where the data warehouse comes in.\n",

A data warehouse can store both current and historical data in one place and is designed to give a long-range view of data over time, making it a primary component of business intelligence [[gcp docs](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-a-data-warehouse)].\n",
