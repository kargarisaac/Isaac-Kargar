    "[ZenML](https://github.com/zenml-io/zenml/) is an excellent tool for this task, as it is straightforward and intuitive to use and has [integrations](https://docs.zenml.io/mlops-stacks/integrations) with most of the advanced MLOps tools we will want to use later. Make sure you have ZenML installed (via `pip install zenml`). Let's run some commands to make sure you start with a fresh ML stack. You can ignore the details for now, as we will learn about it in more detail in a later chapter."
