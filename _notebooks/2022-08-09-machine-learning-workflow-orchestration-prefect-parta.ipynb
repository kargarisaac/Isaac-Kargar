I'll demonstrate how to complete the task using two popular tools: Prefect and ZenML. There are several incredible tools that we cannot include in this article, such as Flyte, Kale, Aro, etc.\n",

    "> As an ML practitioner, you are probably familiar with building ML models using Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, or similar. An **[ML Pipeline](https://docs.zenml.io/developer-guide/steps-and-pipelines)** is simply an extension, including other steps you would typically do before or after building a model, like data acquisition, preprocessing, model deployment, or monitoring. The ML pipeline essentially defines a step-by-step procedure of your work as an ML practitioner. Defining ML pipelines explicitly in code is great because: <br>\n",
    "> - We can easily rerun all of our work, not just the model, eliminating bugs and making our models easier to reproduce.\n",
    "> - Data and models can be versioned and tracked, so we can see at a glance which dataset a model was trained on and how it compares to other models.\n",
    "> - If the entire pipeline is coded up, we can automate many operational tasks, like retraining and redeploying models when the underlying problem or data changes or rolling out new and improved models with CI/CD workflows.\n",

    "We may have extensive preprocessing that we do not want to repeat every time we train a model, such as in the last blog post where we generated the 'corpus' list.\n",
    "We may also need to compare the performance of different models, or wish to deploy the model and monitor data and model performance. Here, ML pipelines come into play, allowing us to specify our workflows as a series of modular processes that can subsequently be combined.\n",

    "Initially, we have a postgresql database and possibly a process that writes data to a parquet file. Next, we use pandas to consume the parquet file and merge it with the API data we're pulling.\n",

    "Clearly, these phases are interconnected; if one fails, the entire pipeline will be impacted.\n",
    "Failure can occur in even unforeseen ways. For example, inbound data is flawed, the API fails to connect at random, and the same is true for MLflow. Problems may arise if you are using a database to store MLflow artifacts, such as experiments.
