            "content": "Introduction and Motivation . Having access to a model of the world and using it for decision making is a powerful idea. There are a lot of applications of MBRL in different areas like robotics (manipulation- what will happen by doing an action), self-driving cars (having a model of other agents decisions and future motions and act accordingly), games (AlphaGo- search over different possibilities), Science ( chemical usecases), and peration research and energy applications (how to allocate renewable energy in different points in time to meet the demand). . Problem Statement . In sequential decision making, the agent will interact with the world by doing action $a$ and getting the next state $s$ and reward $r$. . We can write this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) as follows: . States $S epsilon R^{d_S}$ | Actions $A epsilon R^{d_A}$ | Reward function $R: S times A rightarrow R$ | Transition function $T: S times A rightarrow S$ | Discount $ gamma epsilon (0,1)$ | Policy $ pi: S rightarrow A$ | . The goal is to find a policy which maximizes the sum of discounted future rewards: $$ argmax_{ pi} sum_{t=0}^ inf gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) $$ subject to $$ a_t = pi(s_t) , s_{t+1}=T(s_t, a_t) $$ . How to solve this optimization problem?! . Collect data $D= { s_t, a_t, r_{t+1}, s_{t+1} }_{t=0}^T$. | Model-free: learn policy directly from data | . $ D rightarrow pi$ e.g. Q-learning, policy gradient . Model-based: learn model, then use it to learn or improve a policy | .",
